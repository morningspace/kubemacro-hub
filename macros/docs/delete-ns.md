### **Description**


This macro is designed to force delete a namespace that is stuck in `Terminating` status.

A namespace can keep `Terminating` for some reason. To force delete such a namespace, this
macro runs `kubectl delete` to trigger the deletion of the namespace if you haven't done so,
then clear the finalizers attached to the namespace.
