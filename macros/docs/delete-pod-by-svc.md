### **Description**


This macro can be used to delete all pods associated with a specified service. This is useful
when you have some services do not function because the pods at the back are failed, and you
want to force restart these pods.

The Kubernetes service is implemented by the corresponding pods. To inspect this, you can print
the service definition and look for `spec.selector` to know which pods are associated with this
service. Take the following service as an example:
```shell
kubectl get svc prometheus-adapter -n openshift-monitoring -o yaml
```
The pods should have `name` label with value `prometheus-adapter`:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: prometheus-adapter
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
spec:
  clusterIP: 172.30.179.161
  ports:
  - name: https
    port: 443
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 6443
  selector:
    name: prometheus-adapter
  sessionAffinity: None
  type: ClusterIP
```

You can list all pods with this label and decide whether or not to delete them to trigger the
pod restart:
```shell
kubectl get pod -l name=prometheus-adapter  -n openshift-monitoring
NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
prometheus-adapter-6856976f54-42jzh   0/1     Pending   0          3d
prometheus-adapter-6856976f54-d428c   0/1     Pending   0          3d
```

It is very tedious to go through all above steps every time when you need to restart the pods. This
macro is aimed to automate the processing by just asking you a service name. Additionally, when you
delete pods, you can also specify options such as `--force`, `--dry-run`, etc. supported by macro
[delete-res](docs/delete-res) since this macro calls delete-res to do the actual deletion.



### **Usage & Options**

**Usage**

kubectl macro delete-pod-by-svc (NAME) [options]

**Options**

```
     --dry-run='none': Must be "none", "server", or "client". If client strategy, only print the object that would be
     --force: Immediately remove resources from API and bypass graceful deletion.
 sent, without sending it. If server strategy, submit server-side request without persisting the resource.
 -h, --help: Print the help information.
 -F, --no-finalizer, clear finalizers of the resources.
     --version: Print the version information.

```

### **Examples**

Here are some examples that you can take as reference to understand how to use this macro in practice.
```shell
# To delete pods associated with a service.
kubectl macro delete-pod-by-svc echo -n foo
# To force delete pods associated with a service.
kubectl macro delete-pod-by-svc echo --force
# To delete pods associated with a service in dry run mode.
kubectl macro delete-pod-by-svc echo --dry-run=client

```

### **Dependencies**

To run this macro, it requires below dependencies to be installed at first:

* [get-pod-by-svc](docs/get-pod-by-svc.md)
* [delete-res](docs/delete-res.md)

### **Code**

?> To install this macro, you can download it [here](bin/delete-pod-by-svc.sh ':ignore delete-pod-by-svc'), or copy the following code into a local file named as `delete-pod-by-svc.sh`, then put it in `$HOME/.kubemacro` directory for KubeMacro to pick up.
