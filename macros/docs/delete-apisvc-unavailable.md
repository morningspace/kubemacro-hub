### **Description**


This macro is designed to delete all API services that are not available. This is useful when you
have API services that do not function for some reason and you want to delete them and re-create 
them.

API services can be failed for many reasons. To check your API services:
```shell
kubectl get apiservice
```

This will list all API services defined in your cluster. By checking the `AVAILABLE` column in the
result list. You may see some API services are marked `False`. For example, below two API services
are marked `False` due to `MissingEndpoints` and `FailedDiscoveryCheck`:
```shell
NAME                                SERVICE                             AVAILABLE                      AGE
v1alpha1.clusterregistry.k8s.io     kube-system/multicluster-hub-core   False (MissingEndpoints)       2d
v1beta1.webhook.certmanager.k8s.io  kube-system/cert-manager-webhook    False (FailedDiscoveryCheck)   2d
```

This macro can enumerate all API services marked `False` and delete them. For each API service to
be deleted, by default you will be prompted with a message to confirm whether or not to delete.
This can be suppressed by specifying `-y/--assumeyes` option.

You can also specify other options supported by `kubectl delete` since esentially it calls `kubectl
delete` to complete the work. For example, use `--dry-run` option to print the API services to be 
deleted and make assessment before you really decide to delete them.
